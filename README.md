## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  clone the project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  yarn install
```

Make a copy of .env.example and remove .example

Enter your supabase url keys in the .env file

To push DB schema

```bash
  yarn db-push
```

Always run web first from root directory, it will start the trpc server.

```bash
  yarn web
```

Then you can start native(mobile) from root directory, it will start the metro server. It will first open a development build by default. If you want to use Expo-go press S in the terminal to switch to go build. Then you can use camera to open the app. Loading the expo app will take some time. Sometimes the loading indicator will not start showing 0/1, then stop the server and run again.

```bash
  yarn native
```

To start Drizzle studio.

```bash
  yarn studio
```

To check wether trpc server is working or not add some data in entries table in drizzle studio and refresh the page. If you see the data in the list then trpc server is working.
